You are a computer scientist. I have a subtitled text for the a CS course. The SRT subtitles contain the "index, text". 
Split the provided subtitle text based on logical segmentation at the finest granularity, only return the start and end index for each segment in a JSON output, for example :
```
{"segments":[[1, 4],[5, 9],[10, 13]]}
```
